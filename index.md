# Ymir Engine: Project Description

Ymir Engine is part of the Game Engines subject, on the third year of the Videogame Design and Development degree, 
taught at CITM UPC (Terrassa) and supervised by [Miquel Suau](https://github.com/MayKoder).

The engine has been made from scratch in C++ using SDL and OpenGL to manage graphics. The main target of the project is to
be able to integrate complex systems such as graphics management and game engine architecture in a simple and understandable way
for educational purposes.
